# Five In a Row
It is a simple board game which is quite popular in Asia. You can think of it as an advanced version of Tick-tack-toe. As name says, you have to set 5 stones in row in 15x15 board. It only takes a few minutes to finish and is really fun! If you want to know more about it, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku

#Background
Originally, I was making an AI for Five In a Row using JavaApplet. My goal was to make a strongest AI I can come up with, and post it to my website as a personal project. However, I soon realized that people stopped using JavaApplet on webpages, and instead, they started to use Canvas to draw images. Therefore, I decided to convert the codes to JavaScript and draw image on Canvas.

#Goal
My primarily goal for this personal project is to learn how to use GitHub. I have never used it before but I have seen it in many places, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn the basics feature of it.

#How to play
To play against my AI, simply select the AI level and click on the board to set a stone. You can hit "Human vs CPU 1," to toggle the side. You can play against your friend, or you can see CPUs playing against each other. You can hit "CPU 2 level:" to toggle the CPUs as well.</br>
